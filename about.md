My name is Luke Hackett, and I create extensible, functional, simple software
solutions to various problems - and for pleasure!

I've been developing code in some form or another for around ten years now.
Since graduating from university I've begun to take on a number of personal
projects, to which can be found on my GitHub.

I like to specialise in full stack development, working with languages such as
Java, Ruby and Python are current trends for me at the moment.
