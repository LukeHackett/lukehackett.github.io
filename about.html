    <h2>About</h2> 
    <p>
      My name is Luke Hackett, and I create extensible, functional, simple software 
      solutions to various problems - and for pleasure!
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been developing code in some form or another since the age of fourteen, 
      with a number of my <a href="{{ '/projects/' | absolute_url  }}">personal projects</a>, 
      can be found on my <a href="{{ site.social.github.url }}" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to specialise in full stack development, working with technologies such as
      AWS, Lambda, Java, Spring Boot, Typescript and ReactJS.
