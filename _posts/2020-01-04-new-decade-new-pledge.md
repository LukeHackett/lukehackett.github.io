I originally setup this blog in 2015, with the aim of the showcasing some of my ideas and thoughts, along with being able to highlight some of my personal projects. How many blog posts did I publish between 2015 and 2019 I hear you ask? Well... just the one!

<!--excerpt-->

My aim for the next decade is quite simple - it is to blog some of my ideas and thoughts on a *regular basis*. I'll also start to showcase some of my side projects that I'm currently (and have been previously) working on.

I'm also trying to gauge the style of writing on the blog, so you might see some rather different writings styles from time to time.

*Happy reading!*
