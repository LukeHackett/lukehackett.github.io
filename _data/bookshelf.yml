  - title: "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship"
    description: |
      Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organisation to its knees. 
      Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it 
      doesn't have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues 
      from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code "on the fly" into a book that 
      will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer — but only if 
      you work at it.
